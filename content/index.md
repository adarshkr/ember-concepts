- HTML, CSS, JavaScript - the building blocks of web pages. You can find documentation of each of these technologies at the
[Mozilla Developer Network](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web "_blank")
- Promises - the native way to deal with asynchrony in your JavaScript code. See the relevant [Mozilla Developer Network section](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise).
- ES2015 modules - you will better understand [Ember CLI's](https://ember-cli.com/) project structure and import paths if you are comfortable with [ES6 JavaScript Modules](http://jsmodules.io/).
- ES2015 syntax - Ember CLI comes with Babel.js by default so you can take advantage of newer language features such as arrow functions, template strings, destructuring, and more. You can check the [Babel.js documentation](https://babeljs.io/docs/learn-es2015/) or read [Understanding ECMAScript 6](https://leanpub.com/understandinges6/read) online.
