Ember is a JavaScript front-end framework designed to help you build websites with rich and complex user interactions. It does so by providing developers both with many features that are essential to manage complexity in modern web applications, as well as an integrated development toolkit that enables rapid iteration.

This open source framework is based on <code>Model–view–viewmodel (MVVM)</code> pattern.

Some of these features that you'll learn about in the guides are:

  - <code>Ember CLI</code> - A robust development toolkit to create, develop, and build Ember applications. When you see an <code>$ ember command </code> instruction throughout the guides, that's Ember CLI!

  - <code>Routing</code> - The central part of an Ember application. Enables developers to drive the  application state from the URL.

  - <code>Templating engine</code> - Use Handlebars syntax to write your application's templates.

  - <code>Data layer</code> - Ember Data provides a consistent way to communicate with external APIs and manage application state.

  - <code>Ember Inspector</code> - A browser extension, or bookmarklet, to inspect your application live.
